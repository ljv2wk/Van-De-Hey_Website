### Hello,

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Politics](https://politics.virginia.edu/) studying American politics at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/). My dissertation research is supervised by [Nick Winter](https://www.nicholasjgwinter.com), [Paul Freedman](https://politics.virginia.edu/freedman), [Justin H. Kirkland](https://jhkirkla.com/), and [Kirill Zhirkov](https://kirillzhirkov.me) and focuses on the intersection of mental health, political identity, and political behavior. Prior to studying at UVA, I earned a B.A. in political science (with high departmental honors) and a B.S. in general biology from the University of California, San Diego.

My broader research interests include public opinion, political psychology, health politics and policy, race and ethnic politics, and research methods.
